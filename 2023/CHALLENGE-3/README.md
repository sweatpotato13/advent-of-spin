# Challenge 3 - 2023

Welcome to the third challenge of Fermyonâ€™s Advent of Spin 2023! ðŸ¥³

For this challenge you'll need to use:

- Spin CLI
- Your favorite programming [language](https://www.fermyon.com/wasm-languages/webassembly-language-support/) supported in Spin
- Working with Spin's LLM feature

If this is your first time with Spin, [Challenge 1 from 2022](../../2022/CHALLENGE-1/README.md), is the perfect introduction. 

This year the stakes are higher, and the challenges...more challenging. The Fermyon elves have decided to help Santa use Serverless WebAssembly for Santa's new web application. Your task is to help the elves get the project up and running before Christmas Eve.

The elves will hang out in the Fermyon [Discord](https://discord.gg/AAFNfS7NGf) server, and can help answer questions along the way.

## Spec

The elves have noticed that we're suddenly almost half-way through advent, so things are becoming a bit hectic. One of things the storyteller-elves suddenly realized, is that they haven't started writing the new Christmas stories for this year.

The elves will need your help in "writing" the most exciting and engaging christmas story of the year. Luckily they have discovered the Serverless AI features of Spin, and they think that might be a good way of doing this.

You can write your application in ANY language that compiles to WebAssembly. To skip the boilerplate, use `spin new` and use one of our language templates.

The elves will use you a random set of words, as inspiration to your story, now it's up to you to figure out how you can prompt the LLMs to use those words to create the most engaging christmas story. Hint: You can try to do a specific kind of style for your story (poem, play, short-story), Who's the narrator?, What's the language like (funny, sad, Simpsons-like)?

The elves will POST to `/` with a JSON object like this (sample data):
```JSON
{
    "place": "North Pole",
    "characters": ["Santa Claus", "The Grinch", "a pingvin"],
    "objects": ["A spoon", "Two presents", "Palm tree"]
}
```

There are no requirements as to how long or short the story can be.

- When posting, the elves expect an HTTP status code `200` to be returned. With the following body:
```JSON
{
    "story": "<YOUR STORY HERE>"
}
```
- Also the header in the response should contain `Content-Type: application/json`

> Note: The above data is an example, the data used when submitting will be different values.
> 
## Test

You can run our [Hurl](https://hurl.dev) test suite with `hurl --test test.hurl`, which will carry out tests, similar to what the elves will use you application for, when you submit it. Ensure you have `hurl` [installed](https://hurl.dev/docs/installation.html).

## Submit

Once the application is deployed, enter the endpoint as serviceUrl below and run the command - e.g., `https://x-mas.fermyon.app`

> Note: Do not add a trailing `/` to the serviceUrl.

```shell
hurl --error-format long --variable serviceUrl="https://x-mas.fermyon.app" submit.hurl
```

Weâ€™ll also post on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/fermyontech) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fermyon), dropping some helpful resources and videos.

Remember there are prizes for each challenge. So it may be you, to whom the elves will deliver a nice award to.
