We've finished our walkthrough elements and now we want to let your festive creativity run wild! The next two challenges will offer you little guidance, but great opportunities to win some prizes from the Fermyon elves.

Build and deploy your own WebAssembly application to Fermyon Cloud and add some tags to your repository for a chance to win some great prizes.

## Challenge 6 Themes

You can build whatever you like and we encourage you to have fun and be creative. However, if you need some inspiration, here are some ideas.

## Automation

- Discord Bot
  - Discord provides webhooks for posting to channels. Can you hook some external source up via the HTTP trigger and alert to Discord?
- Twitter "SaveTo" Bot
  - Zapier, Make.com, Pipedream.com, and others all provide a fantastic integration framework with generious free-tiers. Can you monitor for mentions or HashTags on Twitter and save them to PlanetScale or Airtable?

## Games

  - A classic game that can be played in the browser.
- Classic MUDs
  - Indulge your creativity and build a whole new world with rooms, characters, and a mysterious air of chance.

## Social Media

- Can you use the OpenAI APIs to generate some content?
- Can you generate OpenGraph images for your blog posts?

## Submission Guidelines

- Your code for your application MUST be published to GitHub, though we don't enforce any licensing requirements.

Best of luck!
