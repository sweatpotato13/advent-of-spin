# Challenge 7

Welcome to challenge seven of Fermyonâ€™s Advent of Spin!

## FullStack

In this final challenge we encourage you to build a full-stack application. This should include a frontend application, using Bartholomew or any other framework you can deliver as static assets.

It should consume one or more APIs, delivered as Spin components, to provide an interactive experience.

## Submission Guidelines

- Your code for your application MUST be published to GitHub, though we don't enforce any licensing requirements.
- Your repository MUST be tagged with `spin` and `advent-of-spin` for us to discover it and award prizes
- Your repository MUST include a Fermyon Cloud URL with the deployed application

Best of luck!
