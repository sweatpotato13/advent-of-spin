# Challenge 4

Welcome to challenge four of Fermyonâ€™s Advent of Spin!

This fourth challenge won't introduce you to any new concepts or SDKs, but we don't want to solidify the mindset that working with WebAssembly as a target, using your existing languages and toolchains, mean you can leverage those mature eco-systems of packages and examples.

**Note**: Our backend uses existing crates for calculating the distance and converting to nautical miles. Don't over-think this one.

This challenge is to help the elves write their first utility for Santa's big round the world trip. They need a service that can detect the distance between two points, as described by longitude and latitude coordinates.


## Spec

**Note:** Haversine formula has been used on the verifier to calculate the distance between two points.

Add a new service to your Spin application that can calculate the distance between two lat/long coordinates. The distance will be calculated in nautical miles, rounded to the closest .1 mile.

- 33.76nm == 33.8nm
- 33.94nm == 33.9nm
- 33.44nm == 33.4nm

As always, if you need any assistance, you can join us in the Ferymon [Discord](https://discord.gg/AAFNfS7NGf).

Your application must:

- Accept a JSON payload via POST request to `/distance-latlong`
  - Payload shape: `{ d1: { lat: 0f, long: 0f }, d2: { lat: 0f, long: 0f }}`
- Respond with the `Content-Type: application/json` header
  - Payload response: shape `{ distance: 0f }`

## Test

You can run our [Hurl](https://hurl.dev) test suite with `make test`. Ensure you have `hurl` installed.

## Submit

Enter your Fermyon Cloud endpoint as serviceUrl below and run the command

```shell
hurl --variable serviceUrl="" submit.hurl
```
